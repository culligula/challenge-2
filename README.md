# challenge-2
weekly challenge 2

This challenge is a portfolio. I'll update it with work I've completed in class and possibly work I've completed for fun or practice in my spare time.
The hope is to present it to a potential employer and impress them with my knowledge of HTML and CSS, and whatever else is to come.
the index is on the main level and the sttylesheet and image assets are in the assets folder.
