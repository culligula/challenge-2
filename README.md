# challenge-2
weekly challenge 2

This challenge is a portfolio. I'll update it with work I've completed in class and possibly work I've completed for fun or practice in my spare time.
The hope is to present it to a potential employer and impress them with my knowledge of HTML and CSS, and whatever else is to come.
